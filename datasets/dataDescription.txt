The input variables are as follows:
    air - Surface air temperature - Kelvin degrees
    pressure - Pressure at surface level - Pascals
    rhum - Relative humidity at surface level -%
    uwnd - Wind speed from west to east (x axis) - Meters per second
    vwnd - Wind speed from south to north (y axis) - Meters per second
    WDIR - Wind direction clockwise - Degrees
    WSPD - Average wind speed - Meters per second
    GST - Wind peak speed - Meters per second
    DPD - Dominant wave period - Seconds
    APD - Average period of dominant wave - Seconds
    MWD - Direction from which the dominant wave period comes, DPD - Degrees
    PRES - Pressure at surface level - Hectopascals
    ATMP - Air temperature at the top of the buoy - Celsius degrees
    WTMP - Sea level temperature - Celsius degrees
    DEWP - Dew point taken at the same height as ATMP - Celsius degrees
    VIS - Visibility from the buoy - Nautical miles
    TIDE - Water level in feet above or below the lower average of the water - Feet

The output variable indicates the wave height in the following six hours,
and which has been discretized in 4 classes: {Low, Medium, Moderate, Very High}
